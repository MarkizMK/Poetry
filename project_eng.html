<h1>What's that?</h1>
<p>
Greetings dear recipient.
<br><br>
You might be somehow surprised by this websites content. Don't worry, I'm too. 
<br><br>
It all started one weird evening. My memory of that event is blurry. I opened Notepad on my laptop and wrote a poem. Just like that. No school assignemnt, no my hearts lover to do that for. No actual reason. I just felt like doing it. So it came out... Not exacly satisfactory but metaphorically it had at least three limbs. In the end i enjoyed it.
<br><br>
I decided to continue my poetry ride.
<br><br>
I made this website to put them in place better than a Google Docs file. The idea has been growing on me for some time. But realisation that I won't gain anything from doing nothing while I could actually made me finish it. 
<br><br>
I'm going to be updating this website. In the end i plan to make website and poetry in Polish and English. Hang in there my dudes for more nonsense.
